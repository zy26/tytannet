--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Troubleshooting]:

1] No images on TytanNET toolbar.
   Please close Visual Studio IDE and open the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
   Then type and execute the command:
                devenv.exe /resetaddin Pretorianie.Tytan.Connect

2] Only the administrator who installed the TytaNET has it visible inside the "Add-in Manager" menu.
   It is because by default TytanNET is not installing itself for all the users.
   If you want to enable TytanNET Addin for particular user, just copy the files
   from installation dir (%ProgramFiles%\TytanNET for Visual Studio):
    a) TytanNET.VS2005.AddIn  -- into folder --> %MyDocuments%\Visual Studio 2005\AddIns
    b) TytanNET.VS2008.AddIn  -- into folder --> %MyDocuments%\Visual Studio 2008\AddIns
